** Existing or new script **
Are you inquiring about an existing script you have or would you like guidance creating a new script? If you haven't already, please check out our template scripts repo for common scripting tasks: https://github.com/databrary/Datavyu-Example-Scripts

** Description **
Please describe what you would like assistance with. For new scripts, it is helpful to describe as explicitly as possible the expected result of the script. If you can provide an example Datavyu file or screenshots, it will better help us understand what you need.

For existing scripts, please provide the script (or the relevant portions of it) and any error messages. If you want to add new functionality to a script, please describe the alterations.
